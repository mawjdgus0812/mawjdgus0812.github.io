This paper describes the effectiveness of non-parametric nearest-neighbor distance for OoD detection.
The reason why this method can be effective for generality and flexibility is when, unlike other methods, it does not impose
any distributional assumption. The authors applied nearest-neighbor OoD detection to several benchmarks and establish superior performance.

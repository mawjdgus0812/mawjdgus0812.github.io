This paper describes **the effectiveness of non-parametric nearest-neighbor distance for OoD detection**.
The reason why *this method can be effective for generality and flexibility* is when, unlike other methods, **it does not impose
any distributional assumption**. The authors applied nearest-neighbor OoD detection to several benchmarks and establish superior performance.


## Abstract

> Distance-based methods have demonstared promise, where testing samples are detected as OoD if they are relatively far from in-distribution data. However prior methods impose a strong distributional assumption of the underlying feature space, which may not always hold.

So this paper describes the effectiveness of non-parametric nearest-neighbor distance for OoD detection.

Then, what is the non-parametric nearest-neighbor distance ?
